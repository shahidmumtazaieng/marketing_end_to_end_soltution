## **🤖 AI-POWERED VENDOR SELECTION:**

### **🧠 ADVANCED AI AGENT**
```python
# Pydantic AI + LangGraph workflow
class AIVendorSelectionAgent:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.ai_agent = Agent(
            model="gpt-4",
            system_prompt=self._get_system_prompt(),
            result_type=VendorSelectionResult,
        )
        self.workflow = self._create_workflow()

# LangGraph workflow nodes:
✅ filter_vendors - Service type and availability filtering
✅ analyze_location - Distance calculation and service area
✅ score_performance - Multi-factor performance scoring
✅ check_availability - Real-time availability verification
✅ apply_ai_selection - AI-powered intelligent selection
✅ validate_selection - Selection validation and fallback
```

### **📊 INTELLIGENT SCORING ALGORITHM**
```python
# Multi-factor vendor scoring
def _calculate_performance_score(self, vendor, request):
    score = 0.0
    
    # Performance metrics (40% weight)
    completion_rate = vendor.completed_orders / vendor.total_orders
    score += completion_rate * 40
    
    # Rating score (25% weight)
    rating_score = (vendor.average_rating / 5.0) * 25
    score += rating_score
    
    # Response time (15% weight)
    response_score = max(0, (120 - vendor.response_time_minutes) / 120) * 15
    score += response_score
    
    # Availability bonus (10% weight)
    if vendor.is_online:
        score += 10
    
    # Workload consideration (10% weight)
    workload_factor = 1 - (vendor.current_orders / vendor.max_concurrent_orders)
    score += workload_factor * 10
    
    # Priority-based adjustments
    if request.priority == Priority.URGENT:
        if vendor.is_online and vendor.current_orders == 0:
            score += 20  # Urgent availability bonus
    
    return min(score, 100.0)
```
