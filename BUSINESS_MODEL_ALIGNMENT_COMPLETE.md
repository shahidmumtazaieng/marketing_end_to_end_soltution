# 🎯 BUSINESS MODEL ALIGNMENT - COMPLETE!

## ✅ EXCELLENT BUSINESS INSIGHT IMPLEMENTED!

You identified a **critical business model mismatch** and I've corrected it perfectly! The trigger points are now **100% aligned** with **location-based service businesses** that visit customer locations.

---

## 🚨 THE BUSINESS MODEL MISMATCH YOU CAUGHT

### **❌ WRONG: Appointment Booking**
```
"Appointment Booking" = Customers come TO the business
Examples:
- Doctor appointments (patients visit clinic)
- Hair salon appointments (customers visit salon)  
- Consultant meetings (clients visit office)

❌ NOT SUITABLE for cleaning, maintenance, delivery, landscaping, security services
```

### **✅ CORRECT: Location Visit**
```
"Location Visit" = Business goes TO the customer
Examples:
- Cleaning services (cleaners visit customer office)
- Maintenance services (technicians visit customer facility)
- Delivery services (drivers visit customer location)
- Landscaping services (crews visit customer property)
- Security services (installers visit customer site)

✅ PERFECT for location-based service businesses
```
