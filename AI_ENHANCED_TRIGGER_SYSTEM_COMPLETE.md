## 🚨 THE PROBLEM YOU SOLVED

### **❌ Manual Configuration Issues:**
```
Business Owner Writes:
Keywords: "appointment, book, schedule"

❌ MISSES: "set up", "arrange", "plan", "organize", "reserve", "when can you"

❌ Poor Condition Logic:
Sets: "Customer name required" but not "Contact method required"
RESULT: Can't reach customer even with name!

❌ Vague Instructions:
"When customer wants service" 
BETTER: "When customer explicitly requests scheduling with specific date/time mention"
```

### **✅ AI-Generated Solution:**
```
🤖 AI Analyzes Business Context:
- Business type: "Commercial Cleaning Services"
- Service area: "Office buildings, retail stores"
